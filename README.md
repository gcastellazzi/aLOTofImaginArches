# aLOTofImaginArches

## Rationale

Over the years, I have greatly benefited from various open-source projects, and in turn, I have shared the libraries and toolkits I developed with the broader community. Open source works!

This page serves as an educational resource for undergraduate and graduate civil engineering students. Here, you will find a Matlab software toolkit called aLOTofImaginArches.

The software is available as open-source.

By sharing these resources, I hope to gather feedback and suggestions that will improve their usefulness for everyone.

## Documentation

Several examples are already available in the Example folder.

A simple user guide for the software can be found [here for the use of Loads and Unites](https://github.com/gcastellazzi/aLOTofImaginArches/blob/main/Docs/Load_Graphics_Units.pdf), [here for the development of a circular arch](https://github.com/gcastellazzi/aLOTofImaginArches/blob/main/Docs/Example_Circular_arch_construction.pdf), [here for the development of a sketchd arch](https://github.com/gcastellazzi/aLOTofImaginArches/blob/main/Docs/Example_Sketched_arch_construction.pdf). All these documents are a "click by click" guide to the use of the software.


## Future developments
```
- Support for variable arch thickness
- Handling of multiple units
```
