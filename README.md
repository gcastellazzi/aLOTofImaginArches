# aLOTofImaginArches

aLOTofImagineArches is an educational software that allows for interactive demonstrations that involve the user in experimentation with the funicular solution concept. The tool is designed for the master students of the courses MHMS and HMWS and is mainly useful to capture the idea of ∞³ funicular solutions for masonry arches.

## Rationale

Over the years, I have greatly benefited from various open-source projects, and in turn, I have shared the libraries and toolkits I developed with the broader community. Open source works!

This page serves as an educational resource for undergraduate and graduate civil engineering students. Here, you will find a Matlab software toolkit called aLOTofImaginArches.

The software is available as open-source.

By sharing these resources, I hope to gather feedback and suggestions that will improve their usefulness for everyone.

## Documentation

Several examples are already available in the Example folder.

A simple user guide for the software can be found [here for the use of Loads and Unites](https://github.com/gcastellazzi/aLOTofImaginArches/blob/main/Docs/Load_Graphics_Units.pdf), [here for the development of a circular arch](https://github.com/gcastellazzi/aLOTofImaginArches/blob/main/Docs/Example_Circular_arch_construction.pdf), [here for the development of a sketched arch](https://github.com/gcastellazzi/aLOTofImaginArches/blob/main/Docs/Example_Sketched_arch_construction.pdf). All these documents are a "click by click" guide to the use of the software.
