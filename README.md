# aLOTofImaginArches

Rationale
I have enjoyed a considerable boost to my own work from several open-source projects over the years, and I also have made the libraries and toolkits that I designed myself available to others. Open source works!
The material on this page is intended to be an educational resource for undergraduate or graduate courses of civil engineering students. You will find here a software toolkit for Matlab named aLOTofImagineArches.
The software is available as open-source.
By making these resources available to everyone, I'm hoping to be able to collect feedback and suggestions that will enhance the usefulness of this material for everyone.
